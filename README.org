* Pical2org
A python script to convert an iCalendar file (.ics) to a text file formatted for org-mode.

* Rationale
** What was this project created for?
This project was created to help put my Google and Outlook calendar data into org-mode so there would be a centralized location for me to find my daily tasks and appointments. This script will take any iCalendar file and create a file readable by org-mode.
** Why create this project when there are so many other options out there?
1. I had issues getting the org-gcal package (https://github.com/kidd/org-gcal.el/issues) to work properly with repeating events (https://github.com/kidd/org-gcal.el/issues/165). I also tend to keep my Google or Outlook calendar separate from org-mode as I focus on using org-mode for tasks and projects and I prefer the GUI for creating events as there is more fine detail to the rules for recurring events than org-mode supports with its basic repeaters.
2. The awk script ical2org (https://github.com/msherry/ical2org/blob/master/ical2org.awk) is fantastic, but it does not process EXDATE rules which is something that the python library ~recurring-icalendar-events~ does support.
